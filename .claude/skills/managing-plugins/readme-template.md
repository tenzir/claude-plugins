# Plugin Name

Two to three sentences describing what the plugin does and why it exists. This
introductory paragraph appears in the documentation, so keep it informative and
up to date whenever the plugin changes.

## ✨ Features

Explain the motivation. If this is a workaround for a missing feature, link to
the relevant issue and note when it will become obsolete.

## 🔧 Configuration

Optional section. Document any configuration options if applicable.

## 🚀 Usage

Focus on **how to use** the plugin, not implementation details. For each
component:

- **Commands**: Show invocation (`/plugin:command`) and describe _what it does
  for the user_, not internal steps
- **Skills**: Explain _when_ they activate and _what guidance_ they provide
- **Subagents**: Describe _when to use them_ and _what they accomplish_

Avoid regurgitating numbered implementation steps. Users care about outcomes,
not internals.
