## 📦 Installation

```

```

## 🔧 Configuration

Optional section. Document any configuration options if applicable.

## 🚀 Usage

Focus on **how to use** the plugin, not implementation details. For each
component:

- **Commands**: Show invocation (`/plugin:command`) and describe _what it does
  for the user_, not internal steps
- **Skills**: Explain _when_ they activate and _what guidance_ they provide
- **Subagents**: Describe _when to use them_ and _what they accomplish_

Avoid regurgitating numbered implementation steps. Users care about outcomes,
not internals.
