# Writing TQL Programs

Write TQL (Tenzir Query Language) programs for data pipelines and transformations.

## Fundamentals

Read the following pages unconditionally to understand the foundations of TQL:

- https://docs.tenzir.com/explanations/language.md
- https://docs.tenzir.com/explanations/language/types.md
- https://docs.tenzir.com/explanations/language/statements.md
- https://docs.tenzir.com/explanations/language/expressions.md
- https://docs.tenzir.com/explanations/language/programs.md

Critically, strictly adhere to the best practices in this language tutorial:

## Documentation Lookup

When you need to look up TQL operators, functions, or syntax, spawn the
`docs:reader` subagent with your question. This fetches live documentation from
docs.tenzir.com.
