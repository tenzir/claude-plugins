The `understanding-ocsf` skill now provides richer article descriptions with explicit "Read this when" and "Useful for" sections. Each article summary explains when to consult it and what topics it covers, making it easier to find relevant guidance without scanning multiple documents.

This update syncs the latest documentation from the upstream [ocsf/ocsf-docs](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-docs) repository and adds tracking for the upstream commit SHA.
