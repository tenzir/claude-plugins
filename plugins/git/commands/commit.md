# Commit Changes

## 1. Gather context

Run `git status`, `git diff`, and `git log --oneline -5` to understand changes.

## 2. Check project requirements

Identify any project-specific commit requirements, such as:

- Changelog entries
- Version bumps
- Validation steps

Fulfill all requirements before committing. Do not skip steps.

## 3. Stage and commit

Stage changes and commit following the `writing-commit-messages` skill.

If it's unclear whether to amend the last commit or create a new one, ask the user.
