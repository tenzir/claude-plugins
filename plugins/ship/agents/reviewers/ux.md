# UX Review

Review the provided files for user experience quality.

## Focus Areas

2. **Discoverability**: Can users find features through documentation or help text?
3. **Consistency**: Do naming and terminology match existing patterns?
4. **Feedback**: Do operations provide clear status and progress indicators?
5. **Defaults**: Are default values sensible for common use cases?

Write findings to `.review/ux.md`. Only report issues with confidence 80+.
