# Add emoji reaction-based changelog workflow

The changelog workflow now supports emoji reactions for approving, rejecting, or
modifying changelog entries. React to suggestion comments with:

- 👍 Accept and commit the entry
- 👎 Reject (no changelog needed)
- 😕 Regenerate a new suggestion
- 🚀 Make more technical
- 👀 Make less technical
- 😄 Add more cynical wit
