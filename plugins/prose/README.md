## ✨ Features

- 📝 **Technical Writing Skill**: Guidelines for writing clear, consistent
  documentation following industry best practices

## 🚀 Usage

### `prose:technical-writing` skill

Activates automatically when writing documentation, README files, API docs, code
comments, or user guides. Provides guidance on voice, formatting, word choice,
and inclusive language based on Google's Developer Documentation Style Guide.

**Example scenarios**:

- "Write a README for this CLI tool" - The skill guides sentence structure,
  heading style, and code formatting
- "Document this function" - Ensures active voice and proper use of backticks
  for parameters and return values
- "Create a getting started guide" - Applies procedure formatting with numbered
  steps, location-before-action phrasing, and imperative verbs

**What the skill catches**:

- Passive voice: "An error is returned" becomes "The function returns an error"
- Jargon: "utilize," "leverage," "synergy"
- Non-inclusive terms: "whitelist" to "allowlist," "master/slave" to
  "primary/replica"
- Filler phrases: "please note that," "it should be noted"
- Implied simplicity: "simply," "just," "easy"
