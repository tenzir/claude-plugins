# Skills

## Naming

Use gerund form (verb + -ing): `writing-commit-messages`, `managing-changelogs`

## Descriptions

Use the "Use when" pattern for discovery:

```yaml
description: <What the skill does>. Use when <trigger1>, <trigger2>, or <trigger3>.
```

Good triggers: file types, commands, actions, topics.
